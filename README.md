| Client        | React JS Nginx                                                          | This is the frontend of the application. The client container has Nginx installed which serves the built react app from `build` folder.                                                                                  |
| Auth          | Node JS Postgres SQL                                                    | The auth service handles registration and login of users. It handles the requests to `/api/auth`.                                                                                                                        |
| Teachers      | Node JS Postgres SQL                                                    | This services handles all functionality related to teacher `/api/teachers`. It has a DB of its own which stores the student data redundantly. Hence even if the student or service goes down, it can function perfectly  |
| Students      | Node JS Postgres SQL                                                    | This service handles all functionality of a student `/api/students`. It has a DB which stores teachers data redundantly. Hence even if other services go down, it is not affected                                        |
| Ingress Nginx | [Ingress Nginx Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) | This is the gateway between the outside traffic and our Kubernetes cluster. It routes the traffic to the appropriate routes.                                                                                             |
